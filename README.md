# pac√©t - In Progress

P.A.C.E.T. or Pixel Aspect Color Extraction Tool, is a web app which extracts color data from a given image, at a given point.


## Planned Logic
1. Ability to upload an image or load from URL
2. Extract pixels based on mouse position or touch point
3. Provide feedback relative to selected pixel in varying ways
4. Broadcast color data

## UI

Feedback in the form of:

* Color Box
* R Field
* G Field
* B Field
* Hex Field
* CSS Field [rgb(R,G,B)]
* All field autoselect on focus
* Hex value added to clipboard when color box clicked on
* Extraction toggles on click/touch of the loaded image
